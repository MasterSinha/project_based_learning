<h1>Summary:</h1>
Our project aims to streamline the process of finding hostel accomodation and roommates for college students. Leveraging Python, Kivy and MongoDB, we are developing both website and mobile application to cater to our target audiance of college students and hostel owners.<br><br>
Key features of our platform include an "interested students" student section, allowing users to express interest in specific hostels or roommates, the ability to form teams for housing arrangments, and direct calling functionality to connect with other users or hostel owners. Unlike existing platforms that often require expensive monthly subscriptions for calling privileges, our platform offerw a more affordable pay-per-call model, ensuring cost effective communication for users.<br><br>
By addressing common pain points such as the inability to see existing hostelmates, limited group information options, and high subscription fees, our project aims to simplify the hostel search process and enhance the overall experience for college students. Through seamless integration of features and accessible pricing options, we strive to empower students to make informed housing decisions and forge meaningfull connections within their academic community.
